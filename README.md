# ProgrammingPrinciples

This repository documents my journey through the book *Programming Principles* by Bjarne Stroustrup. It is a record of learning key programming concepts and applying them through practical projects. So far, I have completed five chapters and implemented a **Simple Calculator** as one of my early projects.

## ðŸ“˜ Description

This project is designed to build a strong foundation in programming principles. I follow the chapters of the book closely, and each chapterâ€™s exercise helps me understand and test the theoretical concepts. Currently, the repository contains:

- **Five chapters completed:** Each chapter covers fundamental programming topics and builds up the knowledge required for more advanced challenges.
- **Simple Calculator:** A practical implementation that applies the concepts learned to perform basic arithmetic operations.

- ðŸ”§ **Requirements:** Just ensure you have Python (version 3.8 or higher) or an appropriate development environment installed.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Status:** Active development. More chapters and projects will be added as I progress through the book.

## ðŸ§  Chapters Completed

### Part

- **Chapter 2:** Hello World  
- **Chapter 3:** Objects, Types, and Values  
- **Chapter 4:** Objects, Types, and Values  
- **Chapter 5:** Errors  
- **Chapter 6:** Starting a program


## ðŸ”¢ Simple Calculator

The Simple Calculator project showcases the application of basic programming concepts learned in the early chapters. It includes essential arithmetic operations, control structures, and error handling to perform calculations. Use this as a reference for how to translate theory into practical code.
